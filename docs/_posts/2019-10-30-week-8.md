This week I've learned Websim2.0's code. I learned the code structure and purpose of each directory:
- Assets
- Brains
- Competitive-JS
- Competitive-scratch
- Docs
- Node-modules
- Scratch-editor
- Simcore
- Teleoperators

In addition, I took a look at the possibilities that A-frame offers us to treat collision screens.
