Over the past few weeks, I've come to understand the workings of Cannon physics:
- Extrapolating the acceleration controller to the angular motion.
- I worked on combining my own engine with the cannon engine. To do that, you have to understand the ntrada frequencies of each robot.
- Definition of moment of inertia, maximum torque and maximum force for a robot.
- Letting Cannon materialize gravity and friction.
