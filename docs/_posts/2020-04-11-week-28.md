This week I worked on the study of movement on the ramps of a stage. The results were as follows:
- In free fall, without an autonomous force that prevents the robot from falling down the ramp, the acceleration of the robot's descent does not change if we change the mass of the robot.
- If the friction of the world is increased, the robot advances more slowly and if it is dropped down a ramp without an autonomous force, it falls more slowly than when the world has a lower friction.

Here is a video showing the test:
