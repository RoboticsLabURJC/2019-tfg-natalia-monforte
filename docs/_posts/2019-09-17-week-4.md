This week I've learning about A-frame. For this reason, I've followed the tutorial provided in a YouTube's Channel called A-Frame WebVR. Click [here] to watch the first video of the course.

[here]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dv6_C4UqTfs&list=PLRtjMdoYXLf4inSULAHyCMqpIUj4cmBTr&index=1

The tutorial is based in [A-Frame] official webpage. The tutorial tries to explain the most important tools to start working with A-Frame. The contents are:

- Setting up
- Drawing a box
- Transformations
- Textures
- Animations
- Interacting with objects
- Lighting
- Skybox
- Models
- Images

Now, when I finished the tutorial, I know to do things like that!
