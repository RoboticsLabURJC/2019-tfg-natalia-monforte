During these weeks I have finished the implementation of our engine for a drone. The main problem was getting the drone to stabilize when it was flying at a certain height and the user wanted it to stop.

Finally, this objective has been achieved by eliminating the engine's time references and making the frequency of engine introduction the rhythm set by CANNON.

Below I show two videos. The first one is the result achieved in week 25 and the second one in week 26.
