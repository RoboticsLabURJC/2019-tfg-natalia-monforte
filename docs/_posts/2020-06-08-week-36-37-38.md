This week's tasks have been divided on two fronts:
- Creating a new exercise for the drone. This is a maze in which two versions have been implemented. The first one does not include signalling (the instructions used will indicate the distance to be covered). The second includes signs on the walls that the drone will have to interpret.
- Deepening on the compression of the a-frame loop and the physics loop: The loop is unique. In each iteration of the a-frame rendering loop, CANNON code is executed in which positions and speeds are updated. Therefore, the problem can be solved by creating an auxiliary component that counts the number of ticks that are executed.
