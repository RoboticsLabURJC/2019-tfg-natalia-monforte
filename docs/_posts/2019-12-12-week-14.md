This week I focused on the realistic evaluator.

Once I got the automatic evaluator to show the percentage of room already swept, I decided to make an improvement and make the path taken by the vacuum cleaner circular, because that is the silhouette of the vacuum cleaner. 

Now we really have a realistic evaluator, only the really swept pixels count as sweeps.
