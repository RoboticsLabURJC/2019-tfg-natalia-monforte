This week I made the following progress:
- Study of the AMMO physics engine. It seems that A-Frame will end up leaving aside CANNON and focusing more on AMMO, since it has a better maintenance of the code. Both engines are very similar, even AMMO is based on CANNON.
- Begin to include the physics engine itself in the football exercise.
- Test the CANNON physics in A-Frame, this time without touching up autonomous forces.
