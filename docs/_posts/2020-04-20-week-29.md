This week I studied friction and collisions in a-frame.

- FRICTION:
Differentiation between static and dynamic friction Testing with our own engine. The friction attribute allows to model the friction in an a-frame world.

- COLLISIONS:
Differentiation between static and dynamic collision. Carrying out tests without the engine itself. The restitution attribute allows the simulation of these two types of collision. Elastic collisions transfer 100% of the energy to the colliding body and inelastic collisions maintain 100% of the energy in the colliding body.
