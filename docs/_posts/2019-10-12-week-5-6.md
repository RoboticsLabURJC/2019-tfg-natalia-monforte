This two weeks I've been learning how to create a world in Websim. 

First of all, I decided what might be the first exercise to develop: I'll create a car park where the robot will have to find a place to park and then carry out the parking.

I started with the ground's model and this is the first version of the car park:

Then, I added this ground to a complete world. And finally, I created more robots as objects to have a car park with places occupied by other robots. 

This is the first appearance of the model world:
