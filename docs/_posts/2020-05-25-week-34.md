During this week I continued with the problems of multi-robot physics. To do this, the following changes were made to the code:
- Calculation of the resulting velocity with a square root. In this way, we remove the dependence of sine and cosine.
- Creation of an object for each robot that includes all the variables used in the auxiliary motor.
