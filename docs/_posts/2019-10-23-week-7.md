This week I've started working with 3D models. With this aim, I've learned to use Blender. 

First of all, I watched some tutorials about how to use this tool and what can we make with it.

Once I knew how to work with 3D models, I started to change the look of my car parking giving a car appereance to the robots.
Today, it looks like this.

Then, I started with the ground's model of a new world: a city.

I added this ground to a complete world and I also created a traffic light, a cone, a car and a stop traffic signal 3D model to give more realism to my world.
This is the first appearance of the model world. Nonetheless, there's a lot of work ahead of us!
